# Introduction to Signals and Systems

## What are signals?

Definition: a time-varying function with information of interest.

If we want to get information from a signal, we need to filter, demodulate, or
process it in real-time.

It turns out that all periodic signals can be represented using a Fourier
series, which assists with processing.

Digital sampling is actually incredibly accurate, nearing perfect replication of
analog signals.

## What are systems?

Definition: accepts an input signal and generates an output signal.

If we want to analyze how a system operates on an input, we use transforms,
frequency response characterizations, and convolutions.

## Fourier analysis

Defines how to decompose signals into sinusoids.
