* Frequency Response

If the exponential $e^{j\omega t}$ is fed into an LTI system, you get a sinusoid
$H(j\omega) e^{j\omega t}$ out.

Draw a diagram when solving these problems!

* Sine-in $\rightarrow$ Sine-out

For a BIBO-stable LTI system, a sinusoid will be multiplied by the Fourier
transform of the frequency response function at that frequency.

$$ A \cos (\omega t + \phi) \rightarrow A |H(j \omega)| \cos (\omega t + \phi + \angle H(j \omega)) $$

*NOTE:* Whenever actually solving a problem, use complex numbers -- sinusoids
are awful to work with otherwise.

Always remember: $e^{jx} + e^{-jx} = 2 \cos x$
