* Computing Convolutions
  
Let $\Delta = \frac{T_y}{N}$ where $N$ is the number of discrete spaces. Take 
each function $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $h(t)$ and transform them to $x(n\Delta)$,
$y(n\Delta)$, $h(n\Delta)$, then use the rectangle or trapezoid rule to
numerically integrate them.

Alternatively, Matlab's =conv= function performs discrete convolutions.

* Computing Fourier Transforms

Begin by discretizing the functions. Next, sample the input function at 
$N = 2FT$ (sampling theorem) where $F$ is the frequency bandwidth and $T$ is the
time of a single period. If $N$ is a power of 2 or has many small factors, use
Matlab's =fft= function, which uses the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm.
